Are the Days you count accurate?

I got the idea while listening to 'The Fun in Life' by 'Elton Castee' at 0:38, he says "25,185 about how many days we have alive", from there I had a thought that did they include the leap year days or the six hours every year that turn out to be one day i.e. the 29th February.

What does it do:

So normally people just multiply the number of years with 365 to get the number of days but that's wrong they don't account leap years which does not make a whole lot of difference when there are a small number of days, but a large number the answer would differ slightly
For Example, You take 20,000 days and multiply with 365 you'll get 73,00,000 but you don't account for the leap hours or the extra hours, that's what this small program will do.

Just building on that I made this in a couple of days. (I am a beginner, it took time).

It is not ready yet but I am open to suggestions and improvements.
